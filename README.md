# IP&MV Assignments

This repository contains assignments from two courses: **Image Processing** (Semester 5) and **Machine Vision** (Semester 7). The assignments involve various image processing techniques implemented using Python libraries.

## Assignment 1: Image Resampling

This assignment covers image resampling using two methods:
- Nearest Neighbor Interpolation
- Bilinear Interpolation

The program resizes an image to new dimensions and saves the output for each interpolation method.

## Assignment 2: Noise Filtering

This assignment implements multiple noise filtering techniques:
- Mean Filter
- Median Filter
- K-Closest Averaging Filter
- Threshold Averaging Filter

Various kernel sizes and parameters are applied, and the filtered images are saved.

## Assignment 3: JPEG Compression

This assignment demonstrates the JPEG compression process, which includes:
- Converting an image to YCrCb color space
- Performing block-based DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform)
- Quantization, zigzag scanning, and run-length encoding (RLE)
- Huffman encoding for data compression

## Assignment 4: Image Normalization

This assignment involves:
- Converting an image to grayscale
- Rotating the image by 45 degrees
- Creating an image pyramid with 5 levels
- Magnifying the 3rd level of the pyramid using bilinear interpolation
- Computing the difference between the original and magnified image

## Assignment 5: Canny Edge Detection

This assignment applies Canny edge detection to an image, which includes:
- Gaussian blurring to reduce noise
- Gradient calculation using Sobel filters
- Non-maximum suppression and double thresholding to identify edges
